    <string name="biography_text">Chelsea sees herself as a real life \'Coming to America\' story. Being born in Zimbabwe has
        given her a unique perspective of what we consider the pursuit of life, liberty, and property. Through Pursuit, she hope to become a successful developer
     and entrepreneur. Her goal is to pay it forward through a foundation focused on helping underprivileged people, like herself, learn the technical and soft skills for code. She is a huge Drake, SZA, and H.E.R. fan.
        \nShe is currently a desktop technician and lives in Long Island, New York.</string>

        \n\tKhaing is currently working as an event planner at the City University of New York (CUNY).
        She can throw great parties, meetings or conferences.
